# Knowledge base

This Git-backed Markdown vault is durable memory for Hraness UI. Open `kb/` itself as the vault. Markdown and Git are authoritative. Catalogs, backlinks, graph views, semantic indexes, repository context, and Git projections are derived.

Start repository work with the pinned KB release, then expand through bounded links, exact metadata, text search, or history only when needed:

```sh
bunx --bun github:hraness/kb#v0.15.1 context <repository-path> --root kb --repo .
```

## Record boundaries

- `articles/` holds self-contained captured sources and local assets.
- `notes/` holds maintained concepts and synthesis.
- `plans/` holds proposed through terminal coordination records.
- `riffs/` holds cleaned first-person notes made from dictated or stream-of-consciousness source material.
- `scopes/` holds curated repository-context hubs.

The [[scopes/repository--cdb4ee2aea69|repository context hub]] explains repository-wide rule boundaries. [[notes/documentation-ownership|Documentation ownership]] records the durable split between guides, docs, executable contracts, and KB context. [[notes/repository-seams|Repository seams]] records the stable interfaces that let repositories advance independently.

Git history is the maintenance log. Do not add generated backlink sections or a second append-only fact store. Each record owns its metadata, links, and typed outbound relationships.

## Maintenance

After material KB edits, percolate the changed note, then run:

```sh
bun run kb:refresh
bun run kb:check
```

Parallel lanes run `bun run kb:check:lane` and leave the final refresh to the integrating agent. Render the exhaustive disposable inventory with `bun run kb:catalog`.
